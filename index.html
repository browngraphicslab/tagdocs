        <header id="header_developer">Developer Guide</header>This page will cover how to get started developing for
      the web app, the Windows 8 app, and the server.<br><br>
      <h3>Web app</h3>In the web app, we're using&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>&nbsp;for version control, and our code is hosted on GitHub, so
      the first step for web app development is to get set up with Git.
      Check out the&nbsp;<a dest="#header_git" class="separator_link">Git and GitHub</a>&nbsp;page to the left.<br><br>Now that Git is set up, you'll need to install some Node.js modules, which
      requires first installing&nbsp;<a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. As mentioned on its website, Node is a platform that provides lots of
      utilities that facilitate web app creation. We're using a small subset of Node's
      functionality. In particular, we use&nbsp;<a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a>&nbsp;(for writing cleaner and more flexible
      html),&nbsp;<a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/">Stylus</a>&nbsp;(analogous to Jade, but for css), and&nbsp;<a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>&nbsp;(for automating a lot of tedious things like compiling Jade and Stylus files).<br><br>If you are not already
      familiar with Jade and Stylus, you can take a look at the workshops to the left or
      at other online documentation and tutorials (under the 'Web app links' heading to the left).<br><br>To install Jade, Stylus, Grunt, and any other Node modules we happen to be using,
      navigate to the directory containing your clone of the TAG repository. You will first
      want to install the grunt command line interface using<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ npm install -g grunt-cli</pre>This lets you run the grunt command from your terminal. If it complains about permissions,
      you may need to run the install command as administrator on Windows or using sudo on Macs.
      After grunt-cli is installed, you can run<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ npm install</pre>. There is a file called package.json in the top-level TAG directory that tells npm which
      modules to install, so you should now have everything you need. Again, you might need to
      run this as admin/root.<br><br>To get accustomed to the structure of and normal workflow for the web app, take a look at the&nbsp;<a dest="#header_webappworkflow" class="separator_link">relevant</a>.<br><br>
      <h3>Windows 8 app</h3>If you are working on a Windows 8.1 machine and you're developping the Win8 app in visual studio,
      you may come across an error when you try to run the TAG code stating that something is wrong with 
      Bing maps. Because Win8.1 is not backwards compatible with Win8, you will need to uninstall the current 
      Bing maps SDK in Visual Studio under the TOOLS tab and in "Extensions and Updates". Next, download 
      the Bing maps SDK for Windows 8 from Microsoft, add a .zip extension and extract the Bing.Maps.Xaml.vsix
      file. Click to install the extracted file and finally, you should be able to run your Win8 code on 
      your Win8.1 machine.<br><br>Stay tuned! More information is coming. Let the team lead know if you need this information now...<br><br>

        <header id="header_git">Git and Github</header>A quick look at version control with git for our web app workflow.

      <h3 id="gitwhy">Why Git and GitHub?</h3>Git is a fast and reliable version control system, and it is widely used, making it a
      helpful thing to know. GitHub allows us to create free, private, shared repositories (since
      we have an organizational account). It also has pretty nice issue tracking and is the most
      widely-used code hosting service.
      <h3 id="githubaccount">Set up a GitHub account</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/">github.com</a>.</li>
        <li>Creating an account should be pretty straightforward.</li>
        <li>Make sure you add your full name to your account. It can be difficult to figure out who owns a username like "codehawk723."</li>
        <li>Once you have an account, you'll still need to be added to the TAG team. Email the current team lead!</li>
        <li>Once you've been added, you can take a look at the graphics lab projects <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/browngraphicslab">here</a>.</li>
        <li>
          In order to pull from and push to github, you may need an ssh key. If so, there's probably
          documentation on github about it. If you need to do this and find it non-straightforward, work
          with the team lead to add documentation for it here!
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="gitclone">Clone the repository</h3>The next step is to get a local version of the TAG webapp code, so you can develop on your machine.
      <ol>
        <li><a target="blank" href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Install Git</a> on your machine. If you have any trouble with this, let the current team lead know</li>
        <li>Run&nbsp;<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git help</pre>to make sure Git is working (it should come up with a list of possible Git commands)
        </li>
        <li>If Git is working properly, run&nbsp;<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git clone https://github.com/browngraphicslab/tag.git</pre>to get your local copy of the web app repo. Likewise, you can replace "tag.git"
          above with "win8tag.git" to get a clone of the Windows 8 app repo. By default, a repo will
          clone into a directory with the same name (e.g., a directory called 'tag' for the web app
          repo), but you can change this by adding an argument to the command above, e.g.,&nbsp;<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git clone https://.../tag.git awesome_directory_name</pre>It might look something like this in the terminal:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/gitclone.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/gitclone.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">git clone</div>
            </div>
        </li>
      </ol>tl;dr git clone = "I want that code on my computer"
      <h3 id="gitcommit">Make and commit some local changes</h3>Git is based around the idea of "commiting" code when you have made some tested changes.
      Committing code is like reaching a checkpoint; if something
      terrible happens down the road, you can always return to a past commit, and everything will be okay.
      A "commit" is essentially a collection of changes since the last checkpoint.<br><br>Now that you have a local clone, you can start developing.
      Change directory into the cloned repository and make some
      changes to a file (here we are changing TAG/js/tagInk.js).
      <ol>
        <li>Now, with your changes in place, if you type&nbsp;<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git status</pre>you will see a list of modified files (that is, modified since the last time you committed code)
          as well as some other useful information about the state of your local copy versus the state of
          the last commit:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/gitstatusafterchanges.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/gitstatusafterchanges.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">git status after changes to tagInk.js</div>
            </div><br><br>Running "git status" is kind of a git analogue to running "ls" when you
          change directory -- it can be useful to get your bearings when you enter your repo.
        </li>
        <li>
          Note that the changes to tagInk.js are in the list of those "not staged for commit." If we want our
          changes to be included in the next commit, we will need to add/stage them. This can be done by running<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git add TAG/js/tagInk.js</pre>If we now run git status, we'll see that tagInk.js is staged for commit, meaning
          that it will be included in our next commit:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/gitstatusafteradding.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/gitstatusafteradding.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">git status after tagInk.js has been added</div>
            </div><br><br>Note that if we were making changes to a file that hadn't been committed before, we would first need
          to add it to the git index (i.e.,
          the collection of files git cares about) before it could be committed. We can also do this by running
          git add:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/addingnewfile.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/addingnewfile.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">adding a new file to the git index</div>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>To create a commit from your local changes (i.e., to commit your changes staged for commit), type<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git commit</pre>The next step will be to document your changes. This is done via a short commit message. If you're
          using the Mac terminal or Git Bash (on Windows), you might be prompted to do this using a friendly
          text editor called vim. The vim commands to accomplish this simple task are&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/435555976687923200" target="_blank">notoriously unfriendly</a>, so they're listed in the caption below for convenience:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/vimcommitmessage.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/vimcommitmessage.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">i, &lt;type commit message&gt;, esc, :wq, enter</div>
            </div><br><br>Short explanation: vim is a modal text editor, so keys have different meanings depending on whether
          you are in "INSERT" mode. In INSERT mode, you can actually edit the document. In non-INSERT mode, keys are
          used to navigate quickly around the document. If you are fluent in vim, this would probably be nice. If not,
          you pretty much need to read a&nbsp;<a href="http://vim.rtorr.com/" target="_blank">vim reference</a>&nbsp;before doing anything. Including exiting. With this in mind:
          <ol>
            <li>The "i" command enters INSERT mode (see the bottom of the terminal for "INSERT")</li>
            <li>You can then type your commit message</li>
            <li>Typing "esc" leaves INSERT mode</li>
            <li>Typing ":wq" and "enter" runs the ":wq" command in non-INSERT mode, which saves and quits ("w" is for "write"/"save")</li>
          </ol><br><br>The result of running git commit and typing the commit message will look something like this:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/commitandmessage.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/commitandmessage.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">output of git commit and git status</div>
            </div><br><br>Our "working directory" is now clean, since we've committed all of our changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is a bit cumbersome to go through the process of adding changes, running git commit, and wrestling with vim
          every time we want to commit. Fortunately, there are some flags you can pass to git commit to improve this
          workflow. Running<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git commit -am "a short commit message"</pre>will accomplish these three steps in one. The "-a" flag adds all changes not currently staged for commit before
          committing (note: it does not add new/untracked files to the git index). The "-m" flag tells git that the
          subsequent string ("a short commit message") should be the commit message. Woohoo!<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/gitcommitshortcut.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/gitcommitshortcut.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">git commit shortcut (-am)</div>
            </div>
        </li>
      </ol>tl;dr git commit = "checkpoint!"
      <h3 id="gitpull">Pull in other people's changes</h3>Now your code has been committed to your local clone, and you want to update github to reflect
      your changes. Before doing so, remember that other folks may have updated the shared repository
      since you last synced with github. It's YOUR responsibility to make sure your code is compatible with
      the code currently on github. This can be done by "pulling" the most recent code down from github:<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git pull origin master</pre>Here, "origin" refers to the source of our pull (by default, "origin" is the remote repository from
      which you cloned) and "master" refers to the branch we are pulling (we will go over branches below).
      It is always a good idea to specify the remote and branch names; you might as well, and it makes it
      clear what is going on.<br><br>There are a few things that can happen when you pull:
      <ol>
        <li>You might already be up to date:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/cleanpull.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/cleanpull.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">a clean pull</div>
            </div><br><br>In this case, you can go ahead and push (see below) without further testing, since nobody has
          updated github since you last pulled or cloned.
        </li>
        <li>Git successfully merges some files into your local copy:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/automergepull.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/automergepull.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">git successfully auto-merges</div>
            </div><br><br>In this case, someone else updated/"pushed to" github since your last pull. Git then tries to
          merge their changes into your local clone, and in this case, it succeeded in doing so. You may
          be prompted to enter a commit message if git needed to merge files (merging creates a new commit,
          as described below):<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/pullcommitmessage.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/pullcommitmessage.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">pull commit message</div>
            </div><br><br>Note that it provides a default commit message, so you can just enter ":wq" in this case. In this case,
          ALWAYS TEST your changes again before pushing, since your changes may be incompatible with
          someone else's despite a successful pull (for example, someone might have deleted a function that you
          call in your changes).
        </li>
        <li>
          Git isn't able to merge all files successfully, likely because you edited sections of a file
          that someone else also edited. This is known as having "merge conflicts." For example, say your code
          looks like:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/yourconflictingcode.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/yourconflictingcode.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">your code</div>
            </div><br><br>and Mr. E's code looks like:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/theirconflictingcode.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/theirconflictingcode.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">Mr. E's conflicting code</div>
            </div><br><br>Mr. E sure is devious! If Mr. E then commits and pushes, and you subsequently pull, git will try to
          merge Mr. E's code into yours, which will cause a conflict:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/conflictpull.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/conflictpull.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">merge conflict</div>
            </div><br><br>As indicated by the terminal output, you'll need to fix this conflict manually and then commit to finish
          the merge. Fortunately, git tells you exactly where it failed to merge. Part of this is in the terminal
          output: it tells you that a CONFLICT appeared in TAG/js/tagInk.js. Once we open TAG/js/tagInk, we see:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/conflictincode.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/conflictincode.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">git presents a merge conflict</div>
            </div>In this case, git shows us the lines it failed to merge, surrounded by "<<<<<<<", "=======", and ">>>>>>>".
          The top section, starting with "<<<<<<< HEAD", our local version is given. In the bottom section, starting
          with "========" and ending with ">>>>>>> &lt;commit_number&gt;", the version from github is given. To fix
          the conflict, we just need to pick which of these versions we would like to keep (or mix and match) and then
          delete the other (along with the ">>>>", "====", and "<<<<" symbols).<br><br>After fixing the conflict, running git status will show something like:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/unmergedpaths.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/unmergedpaths.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">git status showing unmerged paths</div>
            </div><br><br>To finish up the commit, first run<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git add TAG/js/tagInk.js</pre><br>Running git status now will show something like:<br><br>
            <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/fixedbutstillmerging.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/fixedbutstillmerging.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
              <div class="captionedImgCaption">conflicts fixed, still merging</div>
            </div><br><br>As indicated in the terminal output, you can finish up the commit by running<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git commit -m "fixed merge conflicts"</pre>You should now have a clean working directory, and pulling again will show that
          you are up to date. As above, make sure to test before pushing.
        </li>
      </ol>tl;dr git pull = "I recognize that your changes matter, too"
      <h3 id="gitpush">Push your changes</h3>After pulling and cleaning merge conflicts (and only then!), you can push your code up to github
      (so other people can pull it down). You can push by running<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git push origin master</pre>As with pulling, it's useful here to specify the remote and branch name to avoid any
      ambiguity. The git push output will look something like:<br><br>
        <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/gitpush.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/gitpush.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
          <div class="captionedImgCaption">git push</div>
        </div><br><br>and you can double-check that your push was succesful by looking at the list of commits in github.<br><br>tl;dr git push = "this code is awesome and tested...take a look!"
      <h3 id="gitbasicusesummary">Basic use summary</h3>Here is a summary of basic use (no branches; just committing, pulling, and pushing):
      <ol>
        <li>Create a new local clone with<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git clone https://github.com/browngraphicslab/tag.git</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Make some local changes</li>
        <li>Commit these changes with<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git commit -am "brief_commit_message"</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Pull in other people's changes with&nbsp;<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git pull origin master</pre>This is a good thing to do frequently as you work to make sure your local copy isn't too far out of sync with
          the project on github.
        </li>
        <li>Push your changes with<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git push origin master.</pre>Always pull and test (if pulling was non-trivial) before pushing.
        </li>
      </ol>Now we'll check out git branches!
      <h3 id="gitHEAD">The HEAD symbol</h3>Before discussing branches, it's helpful to know a bit about the HEAD symbol. We saw this briefly above when
      looking at merge conflicts; git labels your local version with "HEAD" and the remote version with a commit
      number. HEAD just points to the commit (directly or indirectly) that is active in your working directory.<br><br>The current reference in the HEAD symbol is stored in the file .git/HEAD:<br><br>
        <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/gitHEADvalue.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/gitHEADvalue.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
          <div class="captionedImgCaption">looking at HEAD via .git directory</div>
        </div>
      <h3 id="gitbranches">Branches </h3>If you are working on a semi-major feature (anything that will likely take longer than a day or two or that you are
      working on with someone else), you should
      make a branch for your changes. Branches let you keep changes for this feature in a separate, parallel path
      of development, so pulling from and pushing to the branch will not affect the "master" branch. This is handy
      for sharing code under active development, since the master branch should really only contain "finished code."<br><br>You can create a new branch by running the<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git branch &lt;branch_name&gt;</pre>command. You can think of a branch as an entire collection of commits parallel to the master branch, but it may
      also be helpful to think of it in terms of the "branch head," which is just a reference to a commit (the most recent
      on the branch) with a name like "master" or "authoring." When we create a new branch, we are essentially creating a
      new branch head that points to whatever is pointed to by HEAD.<br><br>By creating our new branch, we now have two branch heads (that of our original branch and that of the new branch)
      that point to the same commit*. That means that the next commits on each branch will share a parent, so our
      development path essentially forks.<br><br>The values of the branch heads are stored in .git/refs/heads:<br><br>
        <div class="captionedImgContainer"><a href="images/git/gitbranchheads.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/git/gitbranchheads.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a>
          <div class="captionedImgCaption">can see that the value of the master head matches the last commit</div>
        </div>
      <h3 id="gitcheckout">Checkout</h3>To switch branches, a couple things (internally) need to happen. The version of your files in the current
      working directory needs to be updated to match the branch head, and the HEAD symbol needs to be updated to
      point to the new branch head. The following command takes care of this:<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git checkout &lt;branch_name&gt;</pre>Given that &lt;branch_name&gt; is just a reference to a commit (recall when we looked at the values in
      .git/refs/heads above), it would make sense if we could also switch to a specified (probably previous)
      commit this way. And we can!<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git checkout &lt;commit_number&gt;</pre>If you checkout a commit this way, it's called "detaching" the HEAD, since it now points to a commit directly rather
      than indirectly through a branch head, and there's no longer a permanent reference (e.g., a branch head) to where
      HEAD is pointing. It's fine to make changes in your current working directory now,
      since committing will essentially branch off from wherever HEAD now points (except a branch head has not been set
      up to track these changes). Unless a permanent reference is set up for the detached HEAD, any changes made on this new development path
      will be lost whenever you switch the HEAD to another commit or branch; git will clean it up, since nothing
      references it.<br><br>* from above, in the branch section -- that assumes that HEAD currently refers to a branch head and is not detached.
      <h3 id="gitmerge">Merging </h3>Merging occurs when you want to combine the changes in two different development paths. The term "merging"
      usually comes up when talking about merging two separate branches, but merging happens when
      we pull from github to update our local version of a branch, too; the<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git pull origin branch_name</pre>command is shorthand for<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git fetch origin branch_name
$ git merge branch_name</pre>(which gets the most recent reference for the branch head "branch_name" and merges that commit into our current working
      directory). The process of merging two branches will then seem very similar to standard pulling.<br><br>To merge our changes on a feature branch (branch1) into the master branch, we can use the following procedure (assuming
      we start on the master branch with a clean working directory):
      <ol>
        <li>Update the master:<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git pull origin master</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Checkout branch1:<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git checkout branch1</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Make sure the working directory is clean. Commit if not:<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git status  # see if clean, if not:
$ git commit -am "commit message"</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Run git merge<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git merge master</pre>then fix any merge conflicts (see the&nbsp;<a dest="#gitpull" class="toc_link">git pull section</a>&nbsp;above)
        </li>
        <li>Push branch to github (might as well have the most recent on github, though not necessary)</li>
        <li>Checkout master:<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git checkout master</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Merge branch1 into master:<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git merge branch1</pre>Fix any merge conflicts, commit, pull, and push.
        </li>
      </ol>Note that we could also just run "git merge branch1" from the master branch
      <h3 id="gitrebase">Rebasing</h3>Rebasing, similar to merging, is a way to combine changes on two branches. Whereas merging usually
      works by performing a three-way merge (it merges the two branch heads and the most recent common
      ancestor of the two in order to create a new commit), rebasing attempts to effectively move up the
      point at which the two branches diverged, so the feature branch is "rebased" on top of the most recent
      commit on the master branch. Rebasing a feature branch (branch1) on the most recent master commit
      can be done by running<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git checkout branch1
$ git rebase master</pre>Why might this be useful? For one thing, it creates a cleaner git history, since by rebasing, we're
      rewriting history to be linear rather than di/convergent. This can make it easier to look through past
      issues. For another, you might be partial to rebasing and then merging rather than merging and then merging
      to incorporate a feature branch's changes into the master.<br><br>The&nbsp;<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing" target="_blank">git book's discussion </a>&nbsp;of merging and rebasing has a nice summary of the differences between the two:<br><br>"Rebasing replays changes from one line of work onto another in the order they were introduced,
      whereas merging takes the endpoints and merges them together."
      <h3 id="gitmisc">Some miscellaneous notes</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>PULL OFTEN to ensure that your code is in sync</li>
        <li>This is a thing:&nbsp;<a href="http://gitx.frim.nl/" target="_blank">GitX</a>. Supposedly it's a good merging tool for Macs, but I've never used it. Someone want
          to try it out? There's probably a good one for Windows, too!
        </li>
        <li>
          If you don't want to create a new commit each time you pull, you can instead "stash" your changes. Stashing means that
          you are cleaning your current working directory by sequstering all changes since the last commit. To do this, you
          can run<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git stash</pre>Then when you pull, git only has to merge against your last commit. 
          To re-apply your changes (which might cause merge conflicts the will need to be resolved), run<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git stash apply.
</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <!-- --------------------------------- GRUNT NOTES --------------------------------- //-->
        <header id="header_grunt">Grunt Notes</header>
      <h3>Uses of Grunt</h3><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>&nbsp; is useful for automating the compilation of Jade and Stylus files (into
      html and css files), but it is also useful for concatenating and minifying
      javascript files. We are currently using Grunt to perform the following tasks
      (accordingly, always run the grunt command after editing code):
      <ol>
        <li>Compiling all jade files in the LADS/html directory into corresponding html files</li>
        <li>Compiling stylus files in LADS/css into LADS/css/TAG.css (nice to have only one css file to include)</li>
        <li>Concatenating javascript files into LADS/TAG.js (so users only need to include one js file)</li>
        <li>When we ship, we'll run<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ grunt uglify</pre>which minifies TAG.js into TAG-min.js. Minificaiton is done by replacing variable names
          with mostly one-letter names and removing most whitespace. The resulting file is much
          smaller, which is better for performance.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Running Grunt</h3>There are three basic ways of using Grunt:
      <ol>
        <li>Running<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ grunt</pre>runs the default Grunt tasks (as listed in the Gruntfile -- see below) once.
        </li>
        <li>Running<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ grunt watch</pre>creates a job that watches for any saves in the files listed in the Gruntfile. For
          example, if you run "grunt watch"
          and then save a Jade file, grunt will be run once, and the
          Jade file (along with everything else) will be compiled.
        </li>
        <li>Running<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ grunt &lt;module name&gt;</pre>will run the Grunt task for just that module. For example, running<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ grunt stylus</pre>will only compile stylus files.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Gruntfile.js</h3>The Gruntfile.js file in the top-level directory of TAG controls the tasks that Grunt performs.
      By default, only the 'default' tasks are run. The list of these tasks can be found in the line<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint">grunt.registerTask('default', ['jade', 'stylus', 'concat']);</pre>If you want to add a new Jade or Stylus file to TAG, make sure to add it to the corresponding parts of
      the Gruntfile to ensure that it is compiled.
      <!-- --------------------------------- LOCAL WEB SERVERS --------------------------------- //-->
        <header id="header_webservers">Local Web Servers</header>The TAG web app makes AJAX requests, so it needs to be run on a web server. Fortunately,
      there are ways to set up a local web server! These probably are not the only ones, but they work:<br><br>
      <h3>WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP)</h3>If you are using Windows, this is the one for you!&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/">Check it out</a>. You can follow Xiaoyi's instructions below to set up WAMP:<br><br>After you download WAMP, left click the little "W"
      icon and go to Apache. Under Apache, go to "directory" and click "add Alias". There will be a shell-like
      window popping up and asking for the alias you want to create. Type the alias and hit enter. Then it will
      ask for the address of the directory you want this alias to point to (this will be the path to your TAG
      local checkout). Hit Enter when you are done and the alias you just created will appear in the Apache
      directory list. To access your local copy of TAG, open the browser and navigate to localhost. At the bottom
      of the page you can find the alias you have created and click it to go to your TAG directory. If you want to
      change the path an alias is pointing to, go to the apache directory list and choose the alias. Click edit.
      It will pop up a txt file, where you can find the path and modify it. Also, to make the computers in the lab
      clean and organized, please don't pull a new checkout directly in random folders. I have cleaned the computer
      behind the PPI and move all the webapp checkout into Documents/WEBAPP and all Win8 checkout to Documents/WIN8APP.
      I also created an WAMP alias called WEBAPP pointing to WEBAPP folder. Thus, if you pull a new checkout under WEBAPP/yourname,
      you don't need to create a new alias. I will clean up the other computers some time this weekend. So if you don't
      find your git checkout, don't panic and go to Document/Webapp.<br><br>
      <h3>MAMP (Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP)</h3>This works on Macs.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank">Check out the free version</a>.<br><br>
      <h3>XAMPP (Cross-Platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl)</h3>A possibly friendlier version of WAMP for any platform. Download it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
      Follow the instructions on the installer. If you are running any anti-virus software,
      you might need to temporarily disable it or cancel any scans because they can make the
      installation run very slowly.<br><br>Once the Xampp control panel starts up, start Apache. If you are using Windows and having
      issues starting Apache, there is probably another application running on your computer
      that is using Port 80. A common culprit is Skype, for other possibile fixes check out this
      link: http://www.sitepoint.com/unblock-port-80-on-windows-run-apache/<br><br>Now, go to localhost from one of your web browsers. You should see a Xampp start screen.
      Choose your favorite language to begin.<br><br>localhost/ will act as the same file folder as c:/xampp/htdocs/ (This is the default folder
      Xampp installs into, if you chose to install it into a different folder then use that address).
      Move or create the folder you want to develop from into the xampp/htdocs folder. For example,
      if you save your ‘tag’ folder in xampp/htdocs, you can access it by navigating to localhost/tag. <br><br>Change something in your tag folder, grunt it, and refresh the page. If the change works, you're set! Go Xampp!<br><br>
      <h3>Anvil</h3>Apparently this also works on Macs and is a lot nicer! The potential drawback is that if you're doing 
      any other web development that involves mysql or php, Anvil won't work for that. But for our purposes
      it is probably easier to use than MAMP.&nbsp;<a href="http://anvilformac.com/" target="_blank">Check it out</a>.
      <!-- -------------------------------- STARTER PROJECTS -------------------------------- //-->
        <header id="header_starter">Starter Projects</header>
      <h3>Languages</h3>TAG is an html5/css/javascript application, so to get started, it's important to make sure
      you feel comfortable with each of these languages. Part of this is to make sure you are comfortable
      with the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_Reference/Introduction" target="_blank">DOM</a>. To make javascript easier, we also use&nbsp;<a href="http://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>. You can surf the net to find a good jQuery tutorial.<br><br>

      but this is a small subset of what's out there, so find a tutorial that works for you. You can
      also take a look at the lecture slides from&nbsp;<a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs132/lectures.html" target="_blank">cs132</a>&nbsp;(hopefully you're reading this at a time of year when notes exist on that page). You don't
      need to be a wizard with these languages by the end of your project, but you should be able
      to jump into the TAG codebase and feel relatively at-home. And always feel free to ask questions!
      It might be helpful to take a look at the page on&nbsp;<a dest="#header_debugging" class="separator_link">debugging</a>.<br><br><br>
      <h3>Getting set up with Jade and Stylus for a starter project</h3>The first thing you'll want to do is&nbsp;<a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">install node.js</a>. Jade and Stylus both fall under the node.js platform, so there are nice node utilities
      for working with them. Next, you can run<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ npm install -g grunt-cli</pre>from the command prompt or terminal (it may ask for administrative permissions, so
      you might need to use an administrator command prompt on Windows or run using sudo on Macs).
      This will let you run a handy tool called&nbsp;<a dest="#header_grunt" class="separator_link">Grunt</a>&nbsp;from the command line, which will take care of compiling jade and stylus for you.<br><br>There's a basic starter project template&nbsp;<a href="files/starter.zip">here</a>. Go ahead and download and unzip it. Navigate to the directory. You'll see that it contains
      a .jade file, a .styl file, a package.json file, and a Gruntfile.js file. The package.json 
      file tells node which node packages should be installed for this project (in this case, jade,
      stylus, and a couple utilities). Running<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ npm install</pre>should give you all the necessary packages. Again, you might need admin permissions.
      The Gruntfile has instructions for how to compile your jade
      and stylus files. Running<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ grunt</pre>&nbsp;should now compile .html and .css files from your .jade and .styl files. It is the html
      and css files that the browser will use to render your page, so every time you make changes to
      your jade and styl sources, you should recompile. Fortunately, there is a grunt tool for making
      this less tedious. If you run<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ grunt watch</pre>grunt will wait for any changes in your files and compile when necessary.<br><br>
      <h3>Project options</h3>Email the team lead for the current menu of starter project options.
      <!-- -------------------------------- WEB APP WORKFLOW ----------------------------------- //-->
        <header id="header_webappworkflow">Web App Workflow</header>A general overview of working with the web app. Also, some coding conventions.
      <h3>Structure of the web app</h3>Take a look at the top-level directory of your TAG clone. There's a directory called
      LADS, which has basically all of our code, and there are a couple files called
      package.json and Gruntfile.js. As mentioned in the&nbsp;<a dest="#header_developer" class="separator_link">developer guide</a>, package.json contains a list of TAG's Node.js dependencies, so running<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ npm install</pre>in the top-level directory will install the appropriate Node modules. The Gruntfile
      contains instructions for 'building' the web app, in some sense. Take a look&nbsp;<a dest="#header_grunt" class="separator_link">here</a>&nbsp;for more information.
      In the LADS directory, the main attractions are the html, css, and js subdirectories.
      The first two are pretty self-explanatory, but to find relevant javascript files is
      slightly more difficult. Most javascript files related to kiosk mode (the TAG interface
      that a museum visitor would see) are in js/LADS/layout. For example, the collections view
      page's js file is js/LADS/layout/LADS.Layout.NewCatalog.js. Another important file is
      js/LADS/util/LADS.Util.js, which has a lot of general utility funtions (used by multiple
      other files).
      <h3>Workflow</h3>The basic workflow is to first pull down the latest changes from github with<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ span git pull</pre>If you have local changes, though, you will need to first run<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ git commit -am "commit message"</pre>or<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ span git stash</pre>before pulling. See the&nbsp;<a dest="#header_git" class="separator_link">github section</a>&nbsp;for more information). Then you can run<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ span grunt watch</pre>to watch for any changes. You can then edit away. Commit and pull often
      to make sure your code is well-synced with what is in github.
      <h3>CONVENTIONS</h3>Let's try to create a sane codebase. Our current codebase is insane, and this is our
      chance to fix it. So let's adopt some simple conventions:
      <ol>
        <li>Alphabetize your stylus rules.</li>
        <li>Put common mixins and variables in common.styl.</li>
        <li>
          Mark code that should be completed or cleaned later with a big
          'TODO' in a comment
          so it's easy to search for later.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mark style rules with dubious cross-browser compatibility with 'CBC?'
          so they are easy to search for.
        </li>
      </ol>

      the reasons why people start their TAG careers fixing smaller bugs here and there. If you are developing

        <li>
          If you are making changes that require restructuring or adding code in a significant way,
          sit down with a couple people (including the team lead) to make sure your approach is solid.
          At the very least, type up your notes and post them on the github issue so others can review.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be nice to your teammates: don't commit code that fixes your issue but will create headaches down
          the road.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep things DRY: if the code you're developing in response to a specific issue is in fact
          a solution to a general problem (e.g., centering an image within a div), add it to
          LADS.Util.js so it can be reused.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Style</h3>"Variety is the spice of life" is a nice adage, except when it comes to style in a large
      codebase. When you write new code, put yourself in the shoes of a new TAG developer.
      There is plenty to get used to without adding "decipher four coding styles within the same function"
      to the list. As such, try to follow these basic principles:
      <ol>
        <li>Declare variables at the top of the outermost function in which they are used. For example,<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">function doUselessThing() {
    var a = 5      // will be returned
        i,         // iteration counter
        j;         // temp
        
    for(i=0; i<10; i++) {
        j = i + a;
        a = j;
    }
    
    return a;
}</pre>rather than<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">function doUselessThing() {
    var a = 5;
    
    for(var i=0; i<10; i++) {
        var j = i + a;
        a = j;
    }
    
    return a;
}</pre>Related: see the javascript workshop notes on function scoping.
        </li>
        <li>
          Javascript doesn't require curly braces around one-line conditional or iteration blocks,
          but USE CURLY BRACES anyway. This helps readability and avoids potential errors down the road.
          For a real-world example of why this might be an issue, Apple had a&nbsp;<a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/02/24/anatomy-of-a-goto-fail-apples-ssl-bug-explained-plus-an-unofficial-patch/">security flaw</a>&nbsp;that could have been avoided if curly braces were used.<br><br>For example:<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">for(i=0; i<10; i++) {
    doSomething(i);
}</pre>rather than<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">for(i=0; i<10; i++)
    doSomething(i);
    
// or

for(i=0; i<10; i++) doSomething(i);</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Use consistent, 4-space indentation. Trying to read something like this:<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">for(i=0; i<10; i++) {
    if(i===4) {
        return;
        }
doSomething(i);
    doSomethingElse({
    prop1: 'val1'
    });
}</pre>is terrible. Do not push code that has poor indentation
        </li>
        <li>
          Use === rather than ==. See the javascript workshop notes for the difference.
          If you are in a situation where == is actually correct (e.g., you want to check
          if a value is either 4 or '4'), you can probably do the same thing using a couple
          ===s.
        </li>
        <li>Instead of checking things like<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">if(val === undefined)

// or

if(val === null)</pre>just check<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">if(!val) // checks if val is falsy</pre>This is kind of an exception to the previous rule, since it checks for all falsy values,
          but it makes code much more readable.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <!-- --------------------------------- DEBUGGING --------------------------------- //-->
        <header id="header_debugging">Debugging</header>
      <h3>Using the inspector</h3>Knowing how to debug in javascript is very helpful. The main tool at your disposal is the
      inspector, which lets you explore the DOM, add breakpoints, and monitor network activity
      generated by your site. Opening the inspector is slightly different on each browser (as is the
      functionality provided), but usually right-clicking on the page and selecting something
      sounding like "Inspect Element" will do it. We'll just talk about the Chrome inspector here,
      but it's basically the same on most browsers.<br><br>Clicking on the "Elements" tab in the inspector will show a collapsable representation of the DOM.
      If you hover over an element, it will be highlighted in the page itself (with its width and height
      displayed), and its margin and padding will be shown in a different color. Clicking on the element,
      you can see more information about it in the right pane of the inspector (e.g., style rules, event
      handlers, etc...). If you want to experiment with the styling of the page, you can change any
      of the rules or add new ones. Likewise, you can edit attributes of html elements. Here's an example:<br><br><a href="images/inspectorElements.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/inspectorElements.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a><br>Clicking on the "Sources" tab will let you open up a source file related to the page, such
      as a javascript or css file. If you click on a number next to a line in a javascript file, a
      breakpoint will be added at that line. The breakpoint will survive page refreshes. Again, the
      right pane has a bunch of information about the file you're looking at.<br><br>Clicking on the "Console" tab will open a javascript console. Any errors in your js files will
      be printed here, and if you want to add print lines to your code, you can use<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint">console.log('hey hey hey!');</pre>Also, you can type out arbitrary javascript in the console. For example, if you want to check
      if javascript strings have a "length" property, you can type out something like<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint">var a = 'the quick brown fox is overrated'
a.length</pre>If you want to do something more interesting, you can use the console to manipulate elements in
      the DOM. For example, you can make Keanu Reeves celebrate (or not) Brown's upcoming 250th
      birthday:<br><br><a href="images/keanuBrown.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/keanuBrown.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a><br><br>The console can be especially helpful in conjunction with breakpoints...<br><br>
      <h3>Breakpoints</h3>There are two ways to set breakpoints. One, as mentioned above, is to use the "Sources" tab
      in the inspector directly. The other is to insert a line in your code:<br><br>
      <pre class="prettyprint">var a = 5;
debugger;
// some code below</pre><br>If the inspector is open when this code runs, you will hit a breakpoint here. The
      console will have access to all variables that are in scope at this point in the code,
      so if you went to the console and typed "a+1", you would get 6. It's time well spent to
      play around with this kind of stuff.<br><br>
      <h3>Stepping through</h3>When you're at a breakpoint, you can use the buttons that look like:<br><br><a href="images/breakpointButtons.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/breakpointButtons.png" alt="Sorry, image failed to load!" class="pageImg"></a><br><br>to step through your code. The play button will continue until it hits another breakpoint.
      The second button will step over the next line, meaning that if the line includes a function
      call, it will not enter the function being called. The third button will enter any function
      being called on the current line. The last button will return you from the current function.
      <!-- -------------------------------- DOCUMENTATION -------------------------------- //-->
        <header id="header_documentation">Documentation</header>To generate nice documentation, we're using YUIDoc, a system built by Yahoo!
      See the documentation&nbsp;<a href="http://browngraphicslab.github.io/tag/yuidocs/" target="_blank">here</a>.
      <h3>Why?</h3>The TAG codebase can get pretty messy when our focus is hitting a deadline, so we need some
      standards for writing documentation. YUIDoc takes comments in our source files and compiles html
      documents that provide an easy way to access this documentation.
      <h3>Why YUIDoc?</h3>Of the javascript documentation generators listed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lsauer.com/2013/05/javascript-documentation-generator.html" target="_blank">here</a>, YUIDoc seemed to have a good combination of ease-of-use, compatibility with our current development
      practices, and acceptable UI:
      <ol>
        <li>Ease of use: the comment syntax is pretty simple (see&nbsp;<a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/documenting-javascript-with-yuidoc--net-25324" target="_blank">here</a>), and recompiling the html files can be done by typing<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ yuidoc .</pre>in the top-level directory (add the "-q" flag to suppress output)
        </li>
        <li>Compatibility: YUIDoc can be easily installed as a node module with<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ npm install yuidocjs</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          UI: the interface of the generated html files isn't anything to write home about, but it gets
          the job done. YUIDoc presents the relevant information in an easy-to-navigate way, which is
          what's important when it comes to documentation
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Conventions </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          When you write a new function, document it with a "@method" tag (not all functions
          may be methods in the OO sense, but we can conflate the terms for our purposes). Document
          all parameters and return values with the "@param" and "@return" tags.
          Also provide types for these values. For example:<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">/**
 * Returns a notice message given a certain
 * connectivity error.
 * @method getNoticeText
 * @param {String} error    the error type
 * @return {String}         err message to display
 */
function getNoticeText(error) {</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Top-level constructors such as LADS.Layout.Artmode should be documented with a
          "@class" tag. Also add the "@constructor"
          tag to this comment and document any parameters as above. For example:<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">/**
 * The artwork viewer, which contains a sidebar
 * with tools and thumbnails as well as a central
 * area for the deepzoom image.
 * @class LADS.Layout.Artmode
 * @constructor
 * @param {Object} prevInfo   information about
 *                             returning to prev
 *                             page
 * @param {Object} options    information about
 *                             current artwork
 * @param {Doq} collection    the collection we
 *                             came from (if any)
 */
LADS.Layout.Artmode =
       function (prevInfo, options, collection) {
       </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <!-- --------------------------- FACTORING TO JADE/STYLUS ------------------------- //-->
        <header id="header_factoring">Factoring</header>A few notes on factoring javascript files into jade and stylus files.
      <h3>Create the files</h3>You'll just need to create one .jade and one .styl file. The .jade file will go in
      the TAG/html directory, and the .styl file will go in the TAG/css directory. For
      example, if you are factoring TAG.Layout.ArtworkEditor.js, you might consider creating
      TAG/html/ArtworkEditor.jade and TAG/css/ArtworkEditor.styl.
      <h3>Update the Gruntfile</h3>To make sure grunt knows how to compile your files (see the webapp workflow page for
      more information on grunt), go ahead and add the two files you just created to
      Gruntfile.js (following the example of files already included in the Gruntfile). You'll
      notice that the next time you run 'grunt', more files are being automatically compiled.
      <h3>Factor philosophy</h3>Unless it really makes sense for a particular html element to be created dynamically,
      it should go into your .jade file. For example, the img tag containing the Brown logo
      on the splash screen should be in the .jade file, but if you have a button whose click
      handler creates a popup, it's probably okay if that popup is created on the fly. So for
      each call to document.createElement, you'll have to decide whether that element could
      have been 'created' in the .jade file rather than via javascript.
      In terms of styling, the initial styling rules for every element in the page
      should go in your .styl file (even if this element is created dynamically! it still has
      a class or an id). If you see<br>
      <pre class="prettyprint">someJqueryObject.css({...})</pre>slash it and put those
      rules in your stylesheet. The exception is if the call to .css is in some sort of handler
      that changes the existing style rules for the element...
      <h3>The root</h3>Since we're no longer creating the root of a page by calling document.createElement, we
      need to load in the root element of our html file instead. You can do this using the
      TAG.Util.getHtmlAjax function, which takes in the name of the html file to load. You can
      then access any children of the root (e.g., an element with id 'tagunicorn') by calling
      root.find('#tagunicorn').
      <h3>Conflicting CSS</h3>Since we're creating link tags for each stylsheet, there are bound to be some overlapping
      ids and classes that will screw with our styling. There's probably a good way to
      dynamically change the source of a link tag, but until then, we can avoid conflicts by
      starting each stylus rule with the id of the root of that page. This forces CSS to look
      at all children of the root for the given id or class, so it'll never match an #overlay
      on the collections page to an #overlay style rule on the splash screen.
      <!-- --------------------------------- JADE WORKSHOP ---------------------------------- //-->
        <header id="header_jade">Jade Workshop</header>An introduction to using Jade
      <h3>What is Jade?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Jade is an html templating language that makes writing html templates pretty easy. Say goodbye
          to &lt;&gt; and &lt;!-- &nbsp; --&gt;.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jade is based on indentation to avoid the need for closing tags (a la Python, e.g.), and it knows
          which tags are self-closing (e.g. &lt;br /&gt).
        </li>
        <li>
          Jade uses a JSON-formatted "context" to fill pages with interesting content. This is the
          templating side of Jade.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Installing Jade</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Run<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ npm install jade</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>To start</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The easiest way to start using Jade is to look at an existing html file and convert it. Normal
          html is valid Jade (as long as there are no unexpected indents; just un-indent everything to
          start if need be), so you can work through a file and easily test as you go. You'll want to save
          the html file as a .jade file so you can distinguish it from the html file Jade will produce.
          To run Jade on a .jade file (i.e. to compile it to an html file), just run<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">$ jade file_name.jade</pre>This will produce an html file (file_name.html). You can tack on "--pretty" if you want
          to be able to read the resulting html file easily.<br><br>You can take a look at the source for this page&nbsp;<a href="index.jade" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Documentation</h3>Jade has pretty good documentation. The language reference can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://jade-lang.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, and the Jade github page with further documentation can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/jade" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <div style="width:100%;text-align:center;font-size:14px;"><img src="images/thegoodparts.jpg" width="400px">There are a few good parts</div>Below are a few notes about different aspects of Javascript. If there's a topic you'd like to hear more about,
      let the current team lead know, and he/she can update accordingly.<br><br>To test out some of the discussions below, it's helpful to use both the browser inspector and a test file
      (so you can add breakpoints)
      <h3>Functions (p.26 of <i>JGP</i>)</h3>
      <div class="full-text">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Functions have two additional parameters besides those explicitly passed: <span>this</span>
            and <span>arguments</span>. The value of <span>this</span> depends on the way the function is
            invoked. The value of <span>arguments</span> is an array-like object containing the full list
            of arguments passed to the function (array-like because it is an object with integer property
            names, but it does not inherit from Array.prototype). This is helpful because Javascript doesn't
            enforce anything about numbers of arguments passed to functions; you can pass as many or as few
            as you want, and <span>arguments</span> keeps track of them all.<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">function myFunc() {
    // call myFunc(1,2,3,4,5),
    // inspect 'this' and arguments
    debugger;
}</pre>
          </li>
          <li>Functions can be invoked in myriad ways:<br><br>Functions can be invoked as properties of objects. In this case, <span>this</span> is bound to the object. For example:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">var testObj = {
    propertyFunc: function() {
        debugger; // this will refer to testObj
    }
};</pre><br><br>Functions can be invoked via "normal" function invocation. In this case, <span>this</span> is bound to the global object,
            regardless of whether our function is an inner function (in which case we would expect
            <span>this</span> to be bound to the <span>this</span> of the outer function).<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">var testObj2 = {
    propertyFunc: function() {
        innerFunction(arguments); // call inner
        function innerFunction() {
            debugger; // inspect 'this' here
        }
    }
};</pre>To get around this, create a variable like <span>that=this</span> before entering
            the inner function, since <span>that</span> will be visible as a normal variable:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">var testObj3 = {
    propertyFunc: function() {
        var that = this;
        innerFunction(arguments); // call inner
        function innerFunction() {
            console.log(that);
            debugger; // inspect *that* here
        }
    }
};</pre>Note that the name <span>that</span> is completely arbitrary. Could be <span>samuelLJackson=this</span>.<br><br>Functions can also be invoked as constructors (i.e. with <span>new</span>). In this case, a new object will be
            constructed, and <span>this</span> will be bound to the object. REMEMBER if you use
            constructors at all, they must be called with the <span>new</span> operator, since otherwise,
            <span>this</span> will be bound to the global object and you could end up overwriting
            global information!<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">function TestConstructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    debugger; // 'this' refers to new obj
}</pre><br><br>The last way we can invoke a function is by calling
            <span>Function.prototype.apply</span>, which is called as a method of the function. It
            takes the desired value of <span>this</span>
            as its first argument and all other arguments of the function are given in an array in the
            second argument. For example, the following is equivalent to calling the <span>myFunc</span>
            function with the arguments <span>1,2,3,4,5</span> and <span>this</span> set to
            <span>{testProp: 5}</span>:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">myFunc.apply({
    testProp: 5
}, [1,2,3,4,5]);</pre><br>

        <ol>
          <li>
            In Javascript, variables are in scope throughout the outermost function in which they are declared. This
            can be confusing if, for example, you expect a variable just to be in scope in a loop. For
            this reason, it is safest to declare all variables at the top of each function. This will make it
            easier to spot scope-related bugs. Note that inner functions have access to the variables of their
            outer functions, but not vice versa.<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">function scopeTest() {
    var bigScope = 1;
    
    for(var i=0;i<5;i++) {
        var j = 2;
        console.log(i);
    }
    console.log(i+j); // i and j are still in scope
    innerFunction();
    
    function innerFunction() {
        var innerScope = 2;
        console.log(bigScope); // still in scope
        console.log(i+j);      // so are i and j
        debugger;
    }
    
    console.log(innerScope); // bad, crashes
}</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            It is often nice for inner functions to have access to variables from their outer functions, but it can
            cause some weirdness. Consider
            a list of buttons. In creating the click
            handlers for these buttons, the first inclination might be to do something like<br><br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">function handlersInLoop() {
    var i,
        button,
        buttons = [],
        d = document;
        
    for(i=0;i<5;i++) {
        button = $(d.createElement('button'));
        button.text("Button #"+i);
        buttons.push(button);
        $('#contentWrapper').append(button);
        
        button.on('click', function() {
            // always 5 upon clicking
            alert('you just clicked button #'+i);
        });
    }
}</pre><br>However, the variable <span>i</span> used in the click handlers is the same reference as that used
            outside, not a snapshot copy. This means that by the time our click handlers are actually called,&nbsp;<span>i</span>&nbsp;will most likely be&nbsp;<span>buttons.length</span>, and this is not what we want.<br><br>A safer way to do this is to call a helper function that takes the index&nbsp;<span>i</span>&nbsp;and returns
            a function that handles the click on button <span>i</span>. For example:<br><br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">function fixedHandlersInLoop() {
    var i,
        button,
        buttons = [],
        d = document;
        
    for(i=0;i<5;i++) {
        button = $(d.createElement('button'));
        button.text("Button #"+i);
        buttons.push(button);
        $('#contentWrapper').append(button);
        
        button.on('click', buttonClickHandler(i));
    }
    
    // note: helper function *returns* the handler
    function buttonClickHandler(j) {
        return function() {
            // the value of j is correct now
            alert('you just clicked button #'+j);
        }
    }
}</pre><br>We can achieve the same effect in a slightly different way below:<br><br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">function fixedHandlersInLoopClosure() {
    var i,
        button,
        buttons = [],
        d = document;
        
    for(i=0;i<5;i++) {
        button = $(d.createElement('button'));
        button.text("Button #"+i);
        buttons.push(button);
        $('#contentWrapper').append(button);
        
        // closure around creation of the handler
        (function(j) {
            button.on('click', function() {
                // the value of j is correct
                alert('you clicked button #'+j);
            });
        })(i);
    }
}</pre><br>We're essentially doing the same thing here as with the helper function; we're creating
            an inner function and calling it immediately. Note that the variable <span>button</span>
            is still in scope in this inner function. The property that inner functions have access
            to the context in which they are created is called "closure."

      <h3>Asynchronous functions</h3>
      <div class="full-text">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Most basic javascript instructions execute synchronously, meaning that you can expect
            the instruction to complete before the next instruction is executed. This is usually fine,
            but suppose you want to make a request for an artwork in TAG. Who knows when the server
            will respond, so if you wait synchronoulsy for a response, you would lock up TAG's UI. A better
            approach is to make this call asynchonous. The basic idea here is that you accompany your call
            with a "callback" function that will get executed when the call completes. A (slightly abridged)
            example from the TAG codebase is the following (from LADS.Layout.NewCatalog.js):<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">var guid = c.Identifier,
    DB   = TAG.Worktop.Database;
    
DB.getArtworksIn(guid, getArtworksHelper);

function getArtworksHelper(artworks) {
    .
    .
    .</pre>Here, the function <span>getArtworksHelper</span> is provided as a callback function for
            <span>LADS.Worktop.Database.getArtworksIn</span>. This means that when the list of
            relevant artworks is obtained from the server, <span>getArtworksHelper</span> will
            be called, and the list of artworks will be passed in as its argument.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes the results of an asynchronous function are necessary for the execution of any
            subsequent code. In this case, the subsequent code should go in the callback function, since
            this is this only place where it will be guaranteed to get called after the asynchronous
            function returns. This can lead to some gnarly callback nesting if the subsequent code also
            makes asynchronous calls. There are some attempts to make asynchronous calls nicer, like &nbsp;<a href="http://joseoncode.com/2011/09/26/a-walkthrough-jquery-deferred-and-promise/" target="_blank">jQuery.Deferred</a>&nbsp;but we haven't made much use of them (does someone want to give a talk on this??).
          </li>
          <li>
            An asynchronous pattern that shows up here and there in TAG is the async queue. Basically, it allows you
            to add functions to be executed asynchronously to a queue, and when the browser is free, it will perform
            those functions. This is handy for adding lots of DOM elements, for example, since these elements can
            be added during browser downtime, and it will still be possible to interact with the interface. The following
            code (again abridged) from LADS.Layout.NewCatalog.js draws artwork tiles using an async queue:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">var work = works[k].artwork;

loadQueue.add(draw(work, tag, onSearch, k+i, w, h));
.
.
function draw(currentWork, tag, onSearch, i, w, h) {
    // note: draw returns the func to be exec-ed
    return function () {
        var main = $(document.createElement('div'));
        main.addClass("tile");
        .
        .
        </pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h3>Classes and inheritance</h3>
      <div class="full-text">
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first thing to note about inheritance in javascript is the prototype chain. The "prototype" of an object
            is an object from which it inherits properties. When attempting to access the property of an object, javascript
            first looks for the property within the object itself. If it doesn't find the property, it looks in the object's
            prototype. If it still can't find it, it looks in the prototype's prototype, etc. For example, all objects in
            javascript inherit properties from the standard <span>Object.prototype</span>, so adding a property to
            this general object will make it available to all objects:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">function explorePrototype() {
    var a = 5;
    Object.prototype.greeting = "hello";
    var b = [1,2,3];
    
    // hello...hello
    console.log(a.greeting + "..." + b.greeting);
    
    Array.prototype.greeting = "I'm an array";
    
    // hello...I'm an array
    console.log(a.greeting + "..." + b.greeting);
    debugger;
}</pre>Since <span>Array.prototype</span> is closer to <span>b</span> in the prototype chain, javascript will
            encounter the value of <span>Array.prototype.greeting</span> before that of <span>Object.prototype.greeting</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The book (<i>JGP</i>) mentions a few methods for going about inheritance. One is a technique that more closely
            resembles class-based inheritance, where constructor functions are defined and objects are
            new-ed (p.47). In this case, we just add properties to <span>this</span> within the constructor (recall that
            <span>this</span> is bound to the new object when we use <span>new</span>):<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">function Polygon(nSides) {
    this.getNSides = function() {
        return nSides
    }
}

function Triangle(angles) {
    this.isRight = function() {
        return angles.indexOf(90) >= 0;
    }
}
Triangle.prototype = new Polygon(3);

function newObject() {
    var quad = new Polygon(4);
    var triangle = new Triangle([30, 60, 90]);
    debugger;
}</pre>Note that we set the prototype of Triangle to be a new Polygon with three sides, so all the
            properties of a Polygon will be accessible to Triangles via the prototype chain. One problem
            with this approach is that if we forget to use the <span>new</span> keyword when creating
            objects, javascript won't know to use the new object as <span>this</span>, so the global
            object will be used instead, and you can end up overwriting global data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another way to create 'classes,' which we use a fair amount in TAG,
            is to use the 'functional' method. The basic idea is to define a function that
            will create an object, augment it with properties, and then return it. The return
            value of this function will then be an object with the desired properties. For example,
            <span>LADS.Layout.NewCatalog</span> is essentially a constructor function in the above
            sense:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">LADS.Layout.NewCatalog = function (....) {
    .
    .
    var that = {
        getRoot: getRoot,
        loadExhibit: loadExhibit
    };
    .
    .
    return that;
    .
    .</pre>There's not too much exciting getting returned here, but the <span>getRoot</span> method
            is used to retrieve the root of the collections view page, which is then used to
            insert the page into the DOM. An instance of this 'class' is used in
            <span>LADS.Layout.StartPage.js</span>:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">var newCatalog = LADS.Layout.NewCatalog();
...
LADS.Util.UI.slidePageLeft(newCatalog.getRoot());</pre>Before writing these notes, the first line above actually read:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">var newCatalog = new LADS.Layout.NewCatalog();</pre>But this use of <span>new</span> wasn't necessary!<br><br>Inheritance can be implemented by augmenting the value of the object to be returned
            (in the above case, called <span>that</span>, but the name is arbitrary) with the
            return value of the desired superclass. For example:<br>
            <pre class="prettyprint">// superclass
function superhero(name) {
    var that = {}; // could be called anything
    
    that.name = name; // add a property
    
    function hasCape() {
        return true; // of course
    }
    that.hasCape = hasCape; // make hasCape "public"
    
    function hasSidekick() {
        return name.indexOf("man");
    }
    that.hasSidekick = hasSidekick;
    
    return that; // return our superhero object
}

// subclass
function batman() {
    var that = superhero("batman"), // "inheritance"
        butler = "Alfred";
        
    that.doYouHaveABatCave = function() {
        return "duh";
    }
    
    that.doYouHaveAButler = function() {
        return "Yep, named " + butler;
    }
    
    return that;
}

function testFunctionalInheritance() {
    var b = batman();
    console.log("hey, do you have a butler?");
    console.log(b.doYouHaveAButler());
    console.log("hey, do you have a sidekick?");
    console.log(b.hasSidekick());
    debugger;
}</pre><br>Note that this approach provides pretty solid analogues for the notion of public and
            private variables and methods. Variables used within the "constructor" function that
            get added to the object to be returned can be thought of as public, while those that
            are not returned can be thought of as private.

            Declare variables at the top of functions. You might as well,

          <li>Always use blocks/curly braces when possible (avoids a lot of hard-to-spot errors)</li>
          <li>Always use semicolons (otherwise, javascript tries to 'figure it out' and can fail)</li>

      <ol>
        <li>Stylus provides an easy way to write DRY css.</li>
        <li>CSS is generated from .styl files using Stylus.</li>
        <li>You can define variables and even functions to make css creation easier.</li>
        <li>
          You can <a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/docs/extend.html" target="_blank">@extend</a>
          common css rules to cut down on code. 
          
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Eliminate curly braces, colons, semicolons<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">#topbar
    width 100%
    height 110px
    padding-top 20px
    border-bottom 2px solid orangeColor
    </pre>
        </li>
        <li>In the example above, we used a variable <span>orangeColor</span>. Variables can be declared like so<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">zero = 0px
bodyFont = 16px
orangeColor = #ff9614
images = './images/'</pre>
        </li>
        <li>We can define Stylus "mixins" that create style rules based on supplied arguments. Mixins are defined and used like so<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">border-radius(r)
    -moz-border-radius r
    -webkit-border-radius r
    -o-border-radius r
    -ms-border-radius r
    -khtml-border-radius r
    border-radius r
    
pre.prettyprint, code.prettyprint // ooooh meta
    border-radius 8px
    padding-top 5px
    padding-bottom 5px
    padding-left 5px</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Mixins and "functions" are similar, but they are invoked in slightly different situations. Mixins replace entire
          css rules, while functions supply values for properties. They are declared in the same way. Stylus also knows
          what you are trying to do, and you can check if you are trying to use a function in a mixin setting:<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">createUrl(imgName)
    if mixin
        background url(images+imgName)
    else
        url(images+imgName)</pre>This function produces a full rule&nbsp;<span>background url('./images/'+imgName)</span>&nbsp;if it is being used as a mixin (i.e. similar to how&nbsp;<span>border-radius</span>&nbsp;was used above), but it just returns the value&nbsp;<span>url('./images/'+imgName)</span>&nbsp;otherwise:<br>
          <pre class="prettyprint">body
    createUrl('tagUnicorn.png') // used as mixin
    background createUrl('tagUnicorn.png') // not
    </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
